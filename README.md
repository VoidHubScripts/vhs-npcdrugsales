# NPC DRUG SALES



We made this script as an addon to existing drug scripts in FiveM, as most of them lack a decent sell system that encourages rp and works within the confines of the FiveM enviroment. This script will allow players to make deals with existing NPCs on the map, you can set multiple sell locations for each drug as well as sell multiple items / types of drugs in that zone. 


## Features

- Uses Existing Peds on the Map
- Handshake Animations
- Police Alert of Sales Refused (Configuarable %'s)
- Multiple Zones & Items Per Zone
- Prices, Locations, Items, All Configurable
- Discord Logging for Sales



## Compatibility & Dependencies

**Frameworks:** ESX, Qbox, QBCore

**Resources:** ox_lib, ox_target or qb-target


## Installation

 - Ensure all items in the configs/config_main.lua exist in on your server
 - Set your webhook in configs/sv_webhook.lua 
 - Set your own sell zones and items, config them to your servers needs
